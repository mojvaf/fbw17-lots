# Exercise 1 - Use font-awesome icons and text together

Use font-awesome to build a list with three li entries.

See the following image:

![Icons and text](align-icons-and-text.png)

Instructions:

- Pick two different icons from font-awesome (which ones does not matter)
- Place them side by side with some text in between - like in the image. Create three list entries like that
- Hide / remove the default bullet points from the list
- Remove the default padding from the list
- Use span tags around the text between the icons. That way you can "talk to it" via CSS to select & style it
- Align the text relative to the icons using vertical-align like seen in the image (top, bottom, middle)
- Use border around li and margin of 20px between the li tags to see the text alignments better
- At the end: Strike-through the span texts with the text-decoration attribute (google the right value for this on w3schools)

Create the needed HTML and CSS in one file (index.html + embedded CSS).

## Instructions for font-awesome usage

Import font-awesome like any other stylesheet with the link tag in the head section.

Link to the font-awesome stylesheet:  
<https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/5.9.0/css/all.min.css>

Search for icons:  
<https://fontawesome.com/icons?d=gallery>

How to grab the icon code:
Click on an icon that you want. Then you get to the icon details view, like this one:
![Icons and text](fontawesome-copy-iconcode.png)

Click on the HTML / CSS code (in the line below the title) to copy it. Now the icon code is in the clipboard. You can now paste it into Visual Studio Code.
