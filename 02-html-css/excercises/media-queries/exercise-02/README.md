Media Queries: Exercise 2

Make the page in "index.html" responsive!
The posts (in tag "article") are stacked ontop of one another on a mobile display, your task is to change the posts' positions at different breakpoints: 

> At the breakpoint of 600px display two posts next to one another. The third one goes to the next line. Realise this by changing the width. 
> At the breakpoint of 1024px display all posts side-by-side
