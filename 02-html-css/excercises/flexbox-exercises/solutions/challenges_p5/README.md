# Challenge 5 - Flex

We want one fixed sized right column (aside) with very useful info.
And we want the main column to take up all remaining space

Use flex-basis and flex-grow to realize this layout.

On mobile:
- info col (aside) should be hidden
- main should take all available space
- no margin on the body

On tablet:
- info col (aside) is shown and takes 20% of the width
- no margin on the body

On desktop:
- info col (aside) is shown and takes 50% of the width
- margin of the body: 10% left and right
