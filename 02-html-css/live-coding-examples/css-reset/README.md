# Reset the default browser styles

Fetch normalize.css from here (click "Download" to get the css):
[Normalize.css](https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css)

Copy and paste the file contents to a normalize.css file in your project
and link it to all pages.

This way you can set sane default styles for each browser, so your page 
will look closely the same in each of those.
